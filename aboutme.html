    <p>My name is Garrett Little. I grew up in Houston Texas, and moved up to Rexburg for school in the Fall of 2020.</p>
    <p>I am a Computer Science Major.</p>
    <p>I enjoy being active. I like to play Football and Soccer with my friends. Just earlier this year I got into Spartan races (Obstacle Course Races). My next one is in november, and it's a 13 mile, 30 obstacle race!</p>
